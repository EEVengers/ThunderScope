# TODO new rule: NPTH pads.
# Inner diameter of pad should be 0.4-0.5 mm larger than NPTH drill diameter.
# JLCPCB: "We make NPTH via dry sealing film process, if customer would like a NPTH but around with pad/copper, our engineer will dig out around pad/copper about 0.2mm-0.25mm, otherwise the metal potion will be flowed into the hole and it becomes a PTH. (there will be no copper dig out optimization for single board)."

# TODO: new rule for plated slots: min diameter/width 0.5mm
# JLCPCB: "The minimum plated slot width is 0.5mm, which is drawn with a pad."

# TODO new rule: non-plated slots: min diameter/width 1.0mm
# JLCPCB: "The minimum Non-Plated Slot Width is 1.0mm, please draw the slot outline in the mechanical layer(GML or GKO)""
