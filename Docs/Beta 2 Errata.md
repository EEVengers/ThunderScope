## Beta 2 Front End Rework

Remove the covers on the front end shielding cans, repeat the steps below for each channel.

1. Replace "1" with a 220pF 50V COG 0402 Capacitor (GCM1555C1H221FA16D), this will flatten the crossover response and eliminate peaking for square waves under ~100kHz.

2. Replace "2" with a 1.2nF 100V C0G 0603 Capacitor (GCM1885C2A122FA16D), this will increase the frequency for which the maximum 100Vpp input voltage rating applies.

3. Replace "3" with a 50Î© 0402 Resistor, this will eliminate peaking past 300 MHz in the frequency response

## Beta 2 Noise Improvements

In the middle of the board above the fpga module and to the left side of the ADC, locate the buck regulator:

1. Replace "1" with a 120@100MHZ 0402 ferrite bead (BLM15PX121SN1D), leaving room on the left side for 3.
2. Add a 22uF 25V X5R 0805 capacitor (GRM21BR61E226ME44L) across the input cap in position "2"
3. Add a 22uF 25V X5R 0805 capacitor (GRM21BR61E226ME44L) on the left side of "1", in postition "3". Make sure to scrape off the soldermask to make a ground pad for this cap (shown in black)

This should bring the noise to the level shown below:
